Part I
What git command creates a branch? git checkout -b
What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge? fast forwards moves the main branch forward to the feature branch and merges the contents of the feature branch to the main. This can only happen if there have not been commits on the mian branch while the new branch is being worked on. recursive merge will make a commit with the changes from the feature branch(s) and then add them to main. 
What git command changes to another branch? git checkout
What git command deletes a branch? git branch -D
How do merge conflicts happen? When Git can not determine what file or folder to choose when merging since there have been different commits with changes to the same file
